###Chapter 28 Measuring development

##Poverty trap/poverty cycles##

Poverty is usually measured in two ways:

- >**Relative poverty** (which is a comparative level of poverty): A person is said to be in relative poverty if they do not reach some specified level of income.

- >**Absolute poverty**: The level for absolute poverty is measured in terms of the basics necessities for survival. It is the amount people needs to have in order to live.

Cyclical: A change in cause/efficient which is continuous

Barriers to economic growth and economic development

###Economic Development
Measured by the World Bank in USD


Range (GNI/Capita)     | Classification
:--------------------- | :-------------- 
Above \$12476          | High
From \$4036 to \$12476 | Upper Middle
From \$1026 to \$4036  | Lower Middle
Below \$1026           | Low


###Financial measures:###

	GDP per capita may be defined as the total of all economic activity in a country, regardless of who owns the productive assets, divided by the number in the population.

###Human development index (HDI)
<font color="red">**Definition**</font>: Human development index is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development.

###UNDP
<font color="red">**Definition**</font>: The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the United Nations' global development network. Headquartered in New York City, UNDP advocates for change and connects countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build a better life.


###Chapter 27

- ####difference between economic growth and economic development:

	+ Economic development is about reducing poverty so that people can be adequately fed and sheltered. It is about the public provision of **education, health care, maintenance of law and order** It is about the guarantee of civil liberties and the opportunity for civic participation. 

	+ Economic Growth is the **increase of the GDP**.

	+ The economic growth doesn't represent economic development, because the increase of GDP might not be distributed, the economy might not be said to be developed.

- ####Sources of economic growth:
	+ Natural factors: increase of land resource (landfill method; fertilisation; better planning of land usage; better using of the building)
	+ Human capital factors: increased either by encouraging population growth or improving the quality of the human capital. (improve health care; education for children; vocational training; re-training for the unemployed.)
	+ Physical capital and technological factors: Increase the quantity/quality of physical capital, which includes factory buildings, machinery, shops, offices, and motor vehicles. 
		- Capital widening: Increase the total production without increase of the labour productivity.
		- Capital deepening: Increase the amount of the capital for each worker. This often means the improvement of technology, which will lead to improvement of the labour productivity.
	+ Institution (社会福利) factors: Any changes of the law, policy, legislation which will lead to **increase of the GDP**.

- ####Does economic growth lead to economic development?
	+ Higher level of economic growth means the higher level of income, which means the higher level of standard of living with fair distribution of the income. 
	+ Improved economic indicators of welfare:
	Economic growth might not lead to the improvement of economic indicators of welfare (average life expectancy; average years of schooling; literacy rates) just because the government may not want to do it.
	<font color="red">one consequence of economic growth may be an improvement in welfare, measured by HDI</font>
	+ Higher Government revenues: The economic growth will lead to the increase of Government revenue (most time gained by taxation) will make the government provide more essential services like **education, health care, and infrastructure**
	+ Creation of inequality:
	The economic growth will increase the inequal distribution of the income.
	+ Negative externalities and lack of sustainability: -more pollution, -decrease public health and therefore decrease in economic development.

	The economic growth will cause the exhaustion of natural resources, which means the economic growth is not sustainable. 

- ####Common characteristics of developing countries
	- GDP Dependence on primary sector (Fishing, Agriculture, farming)
	- GDP Dependence on Exports of primary commodities
	- High and rising rates of unemployment and underemployment
	- High population rate and size
	- Low per capita real income level
	- Low standards of living == low income, inequility, poor health, and inadequate education
	- low level of productivity
	- Prevalence of imperfect markets and limited information:
