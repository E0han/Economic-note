###Chapter 27

- ####difference between economic growth and economic development:

	+ Economic development is about reducing poverty so that people can be adequately fed and sheltered. It is about the public provision of **education, health care, maintenance of law and order** It is about the guarantee of civil liberties and the opportunity for civic participation. 

	+ Economic Growth is the **increase of the GDP**.

	+ The economic growth doesn't represent economic development, because the increase of GDP might not be distributed, the economy might not be said to be developed.

- ####Sources of economic growth:
	+ Natural factors: increase of land resource (landfill method; fertilisation; better planning of land usage; better using of the building)
	+ Human capital factors: increased either by encouraging population growth or improving the quality of the human capital. (improve health care; education for children; vocational training; re-training for the unemployed.)
	+ Physical capital and technological factors: Increase the quantity/quality of physical capital, which includes factory buildings, machinery, shops, offices, and motor vehicles. 
		- Capital widening: Increase the total production without increase of the labour productivity.
		- Capital deepening: Increase the amount of the capital for each worker. This often means the improvement of technology, which will lead to improvement of the labour productivity.
	+ Institution (社会福利) factors: Any changes of the law, policy, legislation which will lead to **increase of the GDP**.

- ####Does economic growth lead to economic development?
	+ Higher level of economic growth means the higher level of income, which means the higher level of standard of living with fair distribution of the income. 
	+ Improved economic indicators of welfare:
	Economic growth might not lead to the improvement of economic indicators of welfare (average life expectancy; average years of schooling; literacy rates) just because the government may not want to do it.

	+ Higher Government revenues: The economic growth will lead to the increase of Government revenue (most time gained by taxation) will make the government provide more essential services like **education, health care, and infrastructure**
	+ Creation of inequality:
	The economic growth will increase the inequal distribution of the income.
	+ Negative externalities and lack of sustainability: -more pollution, -decrease public health and therefore decrease in economic development.

	The economic growth will cause the exhaustion of natural resources, which means the economic growth is not sustainable.
