##Chapter 1 The foundation of economics

Important definition of economic terms:
####Scarcity

All goods and services that have a price are relatively scarce. This means that they are relative to people's demand for them.

####Choice
Since people do not have infinite incomes, they need to make choices whenever they purchase foods and services. They have to <font color="red">decide how to allocate their limited financial resources</font> and so always need to choose between alternatives. 

####Opportunity cost
Opportunity cost is defined as ** the next best alternative foregone when an economic decision is made**. It is what you give up in order to have something else.

- **free goods**: There are few things, such as air and salt water, that are not limited in supply and so do not have an opportunity cost when they are consumed. We **do not need to give up something else in order to breathe.** These things are known as "free goods", as they are not relatively scarce and so will not have a price.

####The basic economic problem:

- What should be produced and in what quantities?
- How should things be produced?
- Who should things be produced for?

####Factors of production:

#####Land
Include: the land; everything grows on the land or is found under it; the sea; and everything that found under the sea; Natural resources: raw materials, such as gold, coal, oil, and natural gas
#####Labour
The human factor, It is the physical and mental contribution of the existing workforce to production.
#####Capital
- Physical capital

	Which is the stock of manufactured resources, such as factories, machinery, roads and tools

- Human capital
	
	Education or improved health care may be a significant contribution to economic growth. 

#####Management(entrepreneurship)
The organizing and risk-taking factor of production. Entrepreneurs organise the other factors of production---land, labour, and capital--to produce goods and services. 

####Production possibility curves
The PPC are used by economists to show the concepts of scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost, among other things. It shows the maximum combination of goods and services that can be produced by an economy in a given time period.

####Utility 实用性
Utility is a **measure of usefulness and pleasure.** It gives an idea of how much usefulness or pleasure a consumer receives when they consume a product. There are two basic ways of measuring utility:

- Total utility:
	
	The total satisfaction gained from consuming a certain quantity of a product

- Marginal utility:
	
	The extra utility gained from consuming one more unit of a product. (In the majority of cases, the marginal utility gained from extra units of a product falls as consumption increases.)
